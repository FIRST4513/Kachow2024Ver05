start in stowed position

stow -> ground
- raise elev to 2in
- deploy arm

ground -> stow
- keep elev 2in
- move arm to stow angle

------

stow -> shooter
- elev must be at bottom
- move arm to shooter angle

shooter -> stow
- elev must be at bottom
- move arm to stow angle

------

stow -> trap
- elev at bottom
- arm to stow
- elev up to trap height
- arm to trap angle

trap -> stow
- arm from trap angle to stow angle
- elev to bottom

------

stow -> human player
- same as stow -> shooter

human player -> stow
- same as shooter -> stow

----- Button assignment motions -----

A+D.UP = human player: stow -> human player -> until(has gamepiece) -> stow 
A+D.DN = ground intake: stow -> ground -> until(has gamepiece) -> stow

B+D.UP = speaker shoot:
    1. spool shooter
    2. stow -> shooter pos
    3. wait until motors have achieved the correct rotational velocity
    4. [possible wait until swerve has gotten to the right place on the field]
    5. intake feed note into shooter
       - then wait 0.5s
    6. stop motors
    7. shooter -> stow pos

(not a priority):
B+D.DN  = amp: stow -> amp -> intake feed into amp -> stow
B+D.L/R = trap: stow -> trap intake feed into trap -> stow
